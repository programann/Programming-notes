#Building Class Methods and Using Class Attributes
#An instance attribute is responsible for holding information regarding an instance. It is a variable that is available in scope for all instance methods in the class.

# A class attribute is accessible to the entire class â€” it has class scope. A class method is a method that is called on the class itself, not on the instances of that class.

# Class attributes are typically used to store information regarding the class as a whole and class methods enact behaviors that belong to the whole class, not just to individual instances of that class.

# Defining a Class Attribute
# A class attribute is declared using the same notation as anywhere else. We will simply say album_count = 0.

# What's important and what makes this a class attribute is where it is declared. A class attribute must be declared outside of any methods in the class.

# Let's create our class attribute now:

class Album:

    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, date):
        self.release_date = date
# Great, now we have a class attribute to store our count of albums in. Since any Album objects will be built from this class, we can access album_count through the Album class or any Album objects that we instantiate using dot notation.

joshua_tree = Album(1987)
joshua_tree.album_count
# => 0
Album.album_count
# => 0
# If we enter the code Album.album_count += 1, what will Album.album_count become? How about joshua_tree.album_count?


# The class attribute exists, but it should be updated whenever we add a new album. Let's build on this class to make it a bit smarter.

# Manipulating Class Attributes From Instance Methods
# Our album_count is stuck at 0. When and how should we increment it? The count of albums should go up as soon as a new album is created, or initialized. We can hook into this moment in time in our __init__ method:

class Album:

    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, date):
        Album.album_count += 1
        self.release_date = date
# Here we are using the album_count class attribute, inside of our __init__ method, which is an instance method. We are saying: when a new album is created, access the album_count class attribute and increment its value by 1.

# Using our class name and dot notation, we can access our class attributes anywhere in our class: in both class and instance methods.

# Now our code should behave in the following manner:

Album()
Album()
Album()

Album.album_count
# => 3
# We've got an instance method set up now to manipulate our album_count class attribute when we instantiate a new album. This is a very useful feature, but what if we already have an album collection and want to manipulate the album_count attribute without creating new Album objects?

# Defining a Class Method
# A class method is defined like this:

@classmethod
def class_method_name(cls):
    # some code
# What is @classmethod telling the interpreter to do?


# Here, the cls keyword refers to the entire class itself, not to an instance of the class. In this case, we are inside the class only, not inside an instance method of that class. So, we are in the class scope, not the instance scope.

# Let's refactor our Album class so that album_count can be changed by the class itself:

class Album:

    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, date):
        self.increase_album_count()
        self.release_date = date

    @classmethod
    def increase_album_count(cls, increment=1):
        cls.album_count += increment
# Now we have an Album class that increases the number of albums as we get new ones, but that does so through a method connected to the class itself rather than new objects.

# Class Constants
# One other type of variable that can be useful when building out classes is a class constant. Class constants have a lot in common with class attributes. Both constants and attributes:

# Are defined in the body of the class.
# Can be accessed from within a class method.
# Can be accessed from within an instance method.
# A class constant looks a bit different than a class attribute. It's defined using all capital letters, like so:

class User:
    ROLES = ["Admin", "Moderator", "Contributor"]
# When deciding when to use a class constant or a class attribute, the key distinction is that class constants are used to store data that doesn't change (is constant), while class attributes are used to store data that does change.

# For example, we could define a list of valid genres for our album class using a class constant:

class Album:

    GENRES = ["Hip-Hop", "Pop", "Jazz"]
    album_count = 0

    def __init__(self, genre, date):
        if self.check_genre(genre):
            self.increase_album_count()
            self.genre = genre
            self.release_date = date

    @classmethod
    def check_genre(cls, genre):
        return genre in cls.GENRES

    @classmethod
    def increase_album_count(cls, increment=1):
        cls.album_count += increment
# Scope-wise, class constants can also be accessed from outside of the class using this syntax:

Album.GENRES
# => ["Hip-Hop", "Pop", "Jazz"]
# Unlike in JavaScript, declaring a constant variable in Python doesn't actually prevent the variable from being reassigned:

Album.GENRES = "not a list anymore"
Album.GENRES
# => "not a list anymore"
# However, declaring a variable with a constant is still a good indicator to other developers that they shouldn't reassign the variable's value.

# Conclusion
# So far in our object-oriented Python code, we've focused on defining behavior that is specific to an individual instance of a class using instance methods and instance attributes. By also using class methods, class attributes, and class constants, we can expand on our classes' functionality by defining behavior that's not tied to one particular instance of a class, but is related more generally to the class itself.
