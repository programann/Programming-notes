# Inheritance: a tool that allows us to recycle code by creating a class that "inherits" the attributes and methods of a parent class.
# Composition: a tool that enables you to recycle code by adding objects to other objects. Rather than building on a base class as in inheritance, composition leverages the attributes and methods of an instance of another class.
# Subclass: a class that inherits from another class. Colloquially called a "child" class.
# Superclass: a class that is inherited by another class. Colloquially called a "parent" class.
# Child: another name for a subclass.
# Parent: another name for a superclass.
# super(): a built-in Python function that allows us to manipulate the attributes and methods of a superclass from the body of its subclass.
# Decorator: syntax that allows us to add functionality to an object without modifying its structure.
