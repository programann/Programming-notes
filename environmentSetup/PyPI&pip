Installing Packages using Pip
We can use the Pip command to install python packages from the Python Package Index (PyPi). Lets practice this using a package called requests. Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language.

pip install requests
Now we have access to the requests module. It can be imported in our python programs.

$ python
>>> import requests
To install a specific version of the module we can use pip install

pip install requests==2.22.0
Requirements files are files containing a list of modules to be installed using pip install.

pip install -r requirements.txt
Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a requirement is installed, not whether it is installed or not.

pip install -c constraints.txt
Example of a requirements.txt or constraints.txt file.

requests==2.28.1
uvicorn==0.18.2
fastapi==0.79.0
To uninstall a package

pip uninstall requests
Conclusion
Pip can be used to install packages from the Python Package Index. It gives us access to many libraries to help us develop.
